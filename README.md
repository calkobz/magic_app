# Magic App

This is an experimental app designed almost entirely to allow me
to play around with [ZURB Foundation](foundation.zurb.com),
[Haml](haml.info), and, of course, [Ruby on Rails](rubyonrails.org).
Sources of inspiration include the [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](railstutorial.org)
by [Michael Hartl](michealhartl.com).
